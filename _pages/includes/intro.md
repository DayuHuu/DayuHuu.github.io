# üßê About Me

Hi! I am a master student in Software Engineering at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Chao Wu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=gpTPt58AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Before that, I received my Bachelor degree in the CS Department, Hainan University in July 2020.

**Research Interests**: I am mainly interested in data-centric AI or data-driven machine learning, including data security, data efficiency, and data-related applications. My research investigates how to elevate data-centric approaches to improving the performance of machine learning models. My long-term research goal is to mine the role of data in AI, and to democratize AI to serve a broader area and population. Currently, I am focusing on these research topics:
- Data Efficiency: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation, Dataset Condensation
- Data Security: Adversarial Examples, Model Inversion
- Data-related Applications: Federated Learning, Imbalanced Learning, Self-supervised Learning



Previously, I was a research intern at Sony AI, advised by Dr. [Lingjuan Lyu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=0Om30ZUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), exploring AI security and Federated Learning. Before that, I also worked closely with Dr. [Bo Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=NVzQ87sAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra) as a research intern at Youtu Lab, studying Knowledge Distillation and Adversarial Attacks.
