# üßê About Me

Hi!  I am a PHD student in Computer Science at National University of Defense Technology, advised by Prof. [Xinwang Liu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=A56vWC4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Before that, I received my Master degree in the BME Department, Northeastern University in July 2022, advised by Prof. [Xiaoyu Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wDg0KzYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).

**Research Interests**: 

- Bioinformatics: 
My primary research interest lies in the development of advanced clustering methods for single-cell data analysis.  Specifically, I focus on optimizing clustering efficiency, evaluation metrics, and identifying specialized medical scenarios to enable more accurate and relevant cell subpopulation identification.  Through my research, I aim to improve our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and ultimately contribute to the development of personalized medicine.

- Dynamic Graph Learning: 
I am particularly passionate about exploring open graph learning problems, where the identity and total number of node categories dynamically change during the graph formation process.  My long-term research goal is to develop novel methods for category incremental learning in temporal graphs, with the aim of generating effective graph embeddings.  By doing so, I hope to facilitate the representation of dynamic changes and uncover patterns in complex systems, with potential applications in various fields, such as social network analysis and recommender systems.
